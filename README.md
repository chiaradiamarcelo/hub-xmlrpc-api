# Hub XMLRPC API

The Hub XMLRPC API helps to operate SUSE Manager or Uyuni infrastructures with one Server, called a Hub, managing several Servers. The typical architecture is represented below:

Servers are registered and can be managed from the Hub just like normal SUSE Manager or Uyuni clients. In addition to that, the Hub XMLRPC API provides a more convenient way to access all Servers' XMLRPC APIs from one only endpoint in the Hub.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
 - one central SUSE Manager/Uyuni Server (hereinafter: "Hub")
 - two or more peripheral Servers registered to the Hub as Salt clients
 - any number of end clients registered to peripheral Servers
 - a host that can connect to all the peripheral Server's XMLRPC APIs (it can be the Hub itself)
 - credentials to all Server XMLRPC APIs, including the Hub's

### Installation

Install the package `hub-xmlrpc-api`, available from SUSE Manager 4.1 and Uyuni repos, either on the Hub itself or on a host that has access to all Servers' XMLRPC APIs.

**If you are installing `hub-xmlrpc-api` on the Hub** then no further configuration is necessary. The daemon can be started via systemd as a `hub-xmlrpc-api.service` file is provided by the package.

**If you are installing `hub-xmlrpc-api` on a separate host** then you should make sure that the URL to the Hub XMLRPC API is correctly configured in the `/etc/hub/hub.conf` file.

## Additional configuration

`/etc/hub/hub.conf` contains the following configuration parameters:
 - `HUB_API_URL`: URL to the Hub XMLRPC API endpoint
 - `HUB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when connecting to a Server
 - `HUB_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: maximum numbr of seconds to wait for a response when calling a Server method

 Default values should suffice in most settings.

## Usage

Once the `hub-xmlrpc-api` service is running, you can connect to it at port 2830 via any XMLRPC compliant client library (see examples below).


### Namespaces

The Hub API supports 3 different namespaces.

1. `hub` &#8594; to target the Hub itself:
     - example: `hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(username, password)`
2. `unicast` &#8594; to target a single Server registered in the Hub:
     - example: `systems = client.unicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverID)`
3. `multicast` &#8594; to target multiple Servers
     - example: `systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.listUserSystems(hubSessionKey, [serverID_1, serverID_2], [], [])`

Note that:
 - all XMLRPC API methods available in a single Server are exposed by the namespaces above. Generally speaking, they accept the same parameters and return the same values with the exceptions described below
 - the `hubSessionKey` can be obtained via the `client.hub.login(username, password)` method
 - individual Server IDs can be obtained via `client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey)` (see example below)
 - the `unicast` namespace assumes all methods receive `hubSessionKey` and `serverID` as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API
 - the `multicast` namespace assumes all methods receive `hubSessionKey`, a list of Server IDs, then lists of per-Server parameters as specified by the regular Server API. Return value will be an array, indexed per Server, of the results of individual Server calls

### Authentication modes

Hub supports 3 different authentication modes.

1. manual mode (default): user needs to provide API credentials for each Server explicitly
2. relay mode: the same credentials used to authenticate against the Hub will be re-used to authenticate Servers. The list of Servers to connect to will still be provided by the user
3. auto connect mode: Hub credentials will be reused for Servers and any Server the user has access to will be automatically connected

### Python example

```python

#!/usr/bin/python
import xmlrpclib
import itertools
 
HUB_URL = "http://localhost:2830/hub/rpc/api"
HUB_LOGIN = "admin"
HUB_PASSWORD = "admin"
 
client = xmlrpclib.Server(HUB_URL, verbose=0)

# Login (uncomment only one line)
#hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_LOGIN, HUB_PASSWORD)
#hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_LOGIN, HUB_PASSWORD)
#hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAutoconnectMode(HUB_LOGIN, HUB_PASSWORD)

# get list of Server IDs registered to the Hub
serverIDs = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey)

# Manual authentication mode example. Uncomment if `client.hub.login` was uncommented above
#usernames = ["admin" for s in serverIDs]
#passwords = ["admin" for s in serverIDs]
#client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIDs, usernames, passwords)

# Relay authentication mode example. Uncomment if `client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode` was uncommented above
#client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIDs)

# Nothing has to be done if `client.hub.loginWithAutoconnectMode` was uncommented above

# Execute call
systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.listSystems(hubSessionKey, serverIDs)

for system in itertools.chain.from_iterable(systemsPerServer):
  print system.get('name')

#logout
client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey)
```
